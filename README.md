### What I'm pleased with

- The readability of the code
- My refactoring of the prime numbers generator
- The look of the multiplation table
- How rigourous my tests are

### What I'd improve with more time

- Make sure tests for printPrimeMultiplicationsTable are actually passing, I can see they are getting what I want but didn't want to spend too much time trying to fix
- Look into edge cases. Things like, user can only enter a positive integer, user can't enter letters etc.
