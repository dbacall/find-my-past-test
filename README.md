### How to run the app

`npm start`

### How to run tests

In your terminal run:

`npm test`

### What I'm pleased with

- The readability of the code
- My refactoring of the prime numbers generator and abstraction of primeNumberChecker
- The formatting of the multiplation table
- How rigourous my tests are

### What I'd improve with more time

- Look into edge cases. Things like, user can only enter a positive integer, user can't enter letters etc.
- Add error messages for edge cases
- Look further into how to mock return value of primeNumberGenerator, it's my first time doing it with Mocha, and I don't think it's actually working
- Combine with a front end and display on website
